# STEPS TO SET UP PRODUCTION FOR REPLICATION 
## Linux commands and their uses

* **Sudo**:This is a command used in linux to give the user access to all previously sensitive inaccessible files by temporarily giving them administrative privileges. 

* **Pg_cluster** start and stop: This is a program/command which configures a cluster as well as its data path. 

* **Tail-f**: This command prints out the last ten lines of code in a file.

 * **mv**: This is used to move files from one place to another in a file system. It can also be used to rename files.

 * **sshpass**: This is a command used to bypass the password system set up using ssh. 

* **rsync**: This command is used to copy and synchronize files, directories, etc. both remotely and locally as well as mirror between two linux machines. 

* **Postgres**: This is an open source object-relational database system. It has over 30 years of active development and as a result of this it has garnered a strong reputation for its reliability, performance and other good features. It mainly focuses on 9. 1. 2. 3. 10. extensibility and SQL compliance.

* **How to create a user and password in ubuntu**: The first step is to type in the command $sudo adduser (insert username) You will be asked to set a new password, so set a new password and add user information if you want. Enter ‘Y’ to continue. The user will then be added to the system successfully. 

* **What is data replication**: This is the process where data on a server (physical or virtual) is continuously replicated and copied to another, secondary server. This is mainly done for data backup purposes.

## Steps

1. Go into the env.sh file and change the mode to production and save.

2. Go into the terminal and run docker ps --format="ID\t{{.ID}}\nNAME\t{{.Names}}\nImage\t{{.Image}}\nPORTS\t{{.Ports}}\nCOMMAND\t{{.Command}}\nCREATED\t{{.CreatedAt}}\nSTATUS\t{{.Status}}\n"

3. Find the container id of both production and replica.

4. Using the container id run docker exec -it “container id” /bin/bash

5. Run the script “ip a” to check for the ip of both servers.

6. Go into the env.sh and replace replica and production ip with their appropriate ips.

7. Head into the replication.sh and run the bash scripts line by line skipping the scripts with the ‘if [ $mode = 'replica' ]’ on top of it.

8. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to connections”

9. After, go into the env.sh and change the mode to replica and save.

10. Run the scripts in the replication.sh file line by line skipping the scripts with ‘if [ $mode = 'production' ]’

11. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to read-only connections”

# STEPS TO SET UP RECOVERY (FAILOVER)
## Steps 

1. Go into the env.sh file and switch “mode” to production and “prod_status” to down and save.

2. Go into your production server and run source /tmp/mnt.env.sh.

3. Next  run chmod +x recovery.sh.

4. Next run ./recovery.sh.

5. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to replica and “rep_stage” to promote.

6. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to connections”

7. Go into your replica server and run source /tmp/mnt.env.sh.

8. Next  run chmod +x recovery.sh.

9. Next run ./recovery.sh.

10. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to production, switch all other modes to standby and switch “prod_status” to up. 

11. Go into your production server terminal

12. Next run ./recovery.sh.

13. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to replica, switch all other modes to standby and switch “rep_server_backup” to yes.

14. Next run ./recovery.sh.

15. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to production, switch all other modes to standby and switch “prod_server_start” to yes.

16. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept read-only connections”Check the logs.
