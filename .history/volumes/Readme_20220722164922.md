# STEPS TO SET UP PRODUCTION FOR REPLICATION 
## Packages installed to run the script

 * **sshpass**: This is a command used to bypass the password system set up using ssh. 

* **rsync**: This command is used to copy and synchronize files, directories, etc. both remotely and locally as well as mirror between two linux machines. 

## Steps

1. Go into the env.sh file and change the mode to production and save.

2. Go into the terminal and run *_docker ps --format="ID\t{{.ID}}\nNAME\t{{.Names}}\nImage\t{{.Image}}\nPORTS\t{{.Ports}}\nCOMMAND\t{{.Command}}\nCREATED\t{{.CreatedAt}}\nSTATUS\t{{.Status}}\n"_*

3. Find the container id of both production and replica.

4. Using the container id run docker exec -it “container id” /bin/bash

5. Run the script “ip a” to check for the ip of both servers.

6. Go into the env.sh and replace replica and production ip with their appropriate ips.

7. Head into the replication.sh and run the bash scripts line by line skipping the scripts with the ‘if [ $mode = 'replica' ]’ on top of it.

8. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to connections”

9. After, go into the env.sh and change the mode to replica and save.

10. Run the scripts in the replication.sh file line by line skipping the scripts with ‘if [ $mode = 'production' ]’

11. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to read-only connections”

# STEPS TO SET UP RECOVERY (FAILOVER)
## Steps 

1. Go into the env.sh file and switch “mode” to production and “prod_status” to down and save.

2. Go into your production server and run source /tmp/mnt.env.sh.

3. Next  run chmod +x recovery.sh.

4. Next run ./recovery.sh.

5. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to replica and “rep_stage” to promote.

6. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept to connections”

7. Go into your replica server and run source /tmp/mnt.env.sh.

8. Next  run chmod +x recovery.sh.

9. Next run ./recovery.sh.

10. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to production, switch all other modes to standby and switch “prod_status” to up. 

11. Go into your production server terminal

12. Next run ./recovery.sh.

13. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to replica, switch all other modes to standby and switch “rep_server_backup” to yes.

14. Next run ./recovery.sh.

15. Go into the env.sh file and  switch “mode” to production, switch all other modes to standby and switch “prod_server_start” to yes.

16. Check the logs and look for the “database is ready to accept read-only connections”Check the logs.
